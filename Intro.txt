For this project I have chosen to do a simple calculator that adds, subtracts, divides and multiplies whole numbers.
Using floats, structures, linked lists, functions.... I created a pretty neat calculator 
Now since the calculator program was very long and wouldn’t look nice in the main function I put it into a int
function since it returns and put the function at the bottom, so it would look neater. I also created a ascii logo
of my name as a void function and placed it at the bottom. When making these functions I declared them at the top
of the code so the int main can declare them.  I also created a structure to store elements of my age, 
gender, year, university.
